👨🏻‍💻 I am a PhD candidate in my 4th year at the University of Michigan School of Information. 

📚 My research interests are in knowledge and cultural production, science of science, and innovation strategy. More specifically, I'm interested in the sociocultural factors that shape how scientists produce and share new knowledge, as well as organizational practices that promote novel and useful innovation. Current investigations focus on how scientists' working conditions---largely determined at the laboratory level---influence the speed, direction, and quality of science.

🔬 To answer these interdisciplinary questions, I use approaches from the computational social science and applied microeconomics toolkits.

🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 My doctoral work is advised by [Misha Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy), and I am a member of the [Disco Lab](https://www.science-of-science.com/discoverylab). I am currently serving as a union steward in the School of Information and as secretary of the [Graduate Employees Organization 3550](https://www.geo3550.org/). 

🎓 I received my B.A./M.S. 4+1 in International and Development Economics from the University of San Francisco, where I wrote a thesis advised by [Jesse Anttila-Hughes](https://sites.google.com/site/jesseanttilahughes/).
