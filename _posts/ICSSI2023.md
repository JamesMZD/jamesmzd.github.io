Even though Evantson is only a four hour train ride from Ann Arbor, I had a longer commute coming from the Bay Area where I'm staying for the summer. It was awesome attending what may very well become my "home" conference. I could see myself as a part of this research community, especially after presenting my current work with [Misha Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy) on peer reviewer selection and global disparities in the Publication Dynamics session on Day 2. 

Still can't believe Northwestern University has a beach on campus. Not to mention the scenes from the Kellogg Global Hub throughout the conference were exquisite, albeit partially obscured by smokes from the Canadian wildfires.
