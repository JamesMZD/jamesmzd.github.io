This was my first in-person academic conference! I've always wanted to visit DC, so it was great to have a full touring day with my labmate [Hong Chen](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/hong-chen). Having the National Academies of Science as the venue was awe-inspiring, and I enjoyed seeing research from this growing community of folks working to improve science.
