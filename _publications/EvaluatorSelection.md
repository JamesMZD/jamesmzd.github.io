title: "The effect of reviewer geographical diversity on evaluations is reduced by anonymizing submissions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-05-EvaluatorSelection
excerpt: '<b>Preprint</b> We study how geographical diversity among research evaluators affects the success of research producers. If evaluators favor work from their own countries (homophily), then producers from countries well-represented in the evaluator pool will benefit from homophily more often (differential access to homophily), resulting in a “geographical representation bias.” We test if this bias exists in science publishing using peer review data on 205K submissions to 60 journals published by the Institute of Physics Publishing. We find evidence of both homophily and differential access to homophily. Reviewers from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively compared to other reviewers of the same manuscript. Authors from countries well-represented in the reviewer pool (e.g. USA, China, India) are 8-9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers and benefit from homophily. Exploiting a policy shock that led to some papers being reviewed anonymously shows that anonymization causally reduces country homophily to a statistically non-significant level and, consequently, reduces representation bias. Geographical representation bias may be widespread, benefitting authors from wealthier countries that historically produced more research and have greater representation in the evaluator pool. Anonymization is an attractive tool for reducing this bias.'

<b>Preprint</b> Authors from low- and middle-income countries often have lower acceptance rates in academic journals, leading to their ideas receiving less attention. One hypothesized contributor to this disparity is the limited geographical diversity of peer reviewers. If reviewers favor submissions from their own country (i.e. homophily), and authors from certain countries are disproportionately reviewed by same-country reviewers, this creates a “geographical representation bias” favoring those authors. Using administrative data from the Institute of Physics Publishing (IOP), encompassing metadata on 204,718 submissions to 60 STEM journals between 2018-2022, we find strong evidence of this bias. Comparing different reviewers of the same manuscript, we find that those from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively, and authors from countries well-represented in the reviewer pool (e.g., USA, China, India) are 8-9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers. An instrumental variables analysis using an exogenous policy change that created variation in which submissions were anonymized shows that anonymizing submissions does not significantly reduce homophily. These findings provide support for efforts to diversify reviewer pools, and suggest that there are no “quick fixes” for geographical representation bias.
